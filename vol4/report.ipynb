    "To model the robot's movement, we are treating the legs as double pendulums while in air but inverted double pendulums while on the ground. A $\\theta$ parameter represents the angles of the \"thigh\" pendulums, and a $\\phi$ parameter represents the angle of the \"calf\" pendulums. Our state $\\vec{x}$, represents the position of the top of the legs where they connect (see figure below).\n",

    "In the interest of generating a problem we can solve, we decide to abstract it from real world physics, seeing if we can encourage similar behavior mathematically. In other words, we do not consider things such as friction or mass but instead have rules such as the foot being on the ground should fix it in place or neither foot on the ground causes a negative velocity in the y direction.\n",

    "Since our control is defined on a compact set one might think the optimal control would end up being bang-bang but at any discrete timestep we want to avoid extreme motion in the legs. To achieve this we normalize the control by the desired maximum amount of motion at a timestep (such as 5 degrees of change from one frame to another) and then square this term leading to the $(\\alpha_3 u_1)^2$ and similar terms in the cost function.\n",

We also had a hard time motivating movement in the y-axis as shown by the figure on the left.  The model went through many iterations before we found a stable one. In order to get rid of overflow we use a logarithm to split some divisions and then exponentiated the results.  This worked suprising well and we started to see smooth/understandable results.  Unfortunately in all of our experiments we did not succeed in getting the stickman to walk as for why we will elaborate further in the analysis section.  Note the next two figures:\n",

One was solved using the bang-bang solution for the derivatives and the analytical solution for the rest of the control as seen above, the second one was solved by solving for the control using the ODEs found above.  This is important as it suggests a few things.  First it suggests that the analytical solutions and bang-bang switching times found are correct since a numerical solver gave the same control (see the plots of the control to the right).  Secondly it suggests that our stable code implementation probably doesn't have too much wrong with it and the resons we are not getting results is a problem with our state or cost functional we chose.  While this is disappointing it does at least define what is wrong and what could be fixed in future models.\n",

Another improvement would be to solve for one step and then feed the final conditions of taking one step into the initial conditions of the next step, thereby discretizing the walk.\n",

    "The optimization of physical systems can become extremely difficult. Abstracting real world physics into mathematical rules motivated by cost is helpful in order to make this problem solvable in the context of our curriculum.  In the future we hope to redefine the state equation to help motivate 'natural' movement while a leg is not on the ground. We also hope to refine our parameters and the cost function, such as adding a cost for holding a leg in the air for too long. In addition to fixing the models interactions with the floor we hope that these changes will give us a model closer to our desired outcome."

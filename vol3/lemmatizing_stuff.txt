Two main options, WordNet and SpaCy

WordNet is better at catching esoteric words like oxen -> ox, but spaCy is more consistent with common words
Neither option performs spell-checking, but misspelled words can be telling for sentiment anyway

WordNet can only run on one word at a time

    import nltk
    from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
    nltk.download('wordnet')
    
    wnl = WordNetLemmatizer()
    lemmas = [wnl.lemmatize(word) for word in ['confounding','dog','walked','corpora','the','stores']]


spaCy can be run on a full sequence, but said sequence must be tokenized first

    import spacy
    nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')
    
    text = "Corpora walked for miles when Janice's oxen tried to be better at hte dancing."
    # Perform tokenization
    doc = nlp(text)
    # Select lemmas from tokenized string
    lemmas = [token.lemma_ for token in doc]

    "## Dataset Descriptions\n",
    "For our project, we intend to explore a few different branches. Each of these require their own dataset due to the nature of the project, though the methodology will remain largely the same. Our two main branches of exploration are:\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis of Casual Texts\n",
    "    - For this we will use a dataset of over 1.6 million tweets, each labeled with a class related to its sentiment (negative, neutral, or positive).\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis of Reviews\n",
    "    - For this we will use 2 datasets. The first is a set of yelp reviews from <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main\">this link</a>. There are TODO reviews, each labeled with a score out of 5 stars (TODO: CHECK THIS). The second is a set of 50,000 IMDb Movie reviews, each labeled with either a positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation Set\n",
    "Before we began to look at the data in full, we sealed off 20% of each set to save for a final analysis. This was split via files, and as such we will not be able to access the validation sets unless we specifically load those files in our code. The split was chosen randomly and immediately saved into a separate file.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Yelp Dataset is 5GB, and I don't have near enough space on my computer for that. Do it on another computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Access\n",
    "All the data can be found in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hp54gH3TQ93ELuzkHJI76C1nXsSI5CpE?usp=sharing\">this Google Drive folder.</a>"
